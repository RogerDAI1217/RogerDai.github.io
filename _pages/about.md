I'm Tianyuan (Roger) Dai, a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford University, affiliated with the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/). I have the privilege of conducting cutting-edge research in embodied AI and robotic learning, advised by Prof. [Fei-Fei Li](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/fei-fei-li). Previously, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I worked on 3D and multimodal generation, advised by Prof. [Chi-Keung TANG](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/cktang) and Prof. [Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io/). 

Special thanks to Prof. [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/), whose talk at HKUST in my final undergraduate semester inspired me to transition from computer vision to embodied AI. I am also deeply grateful to [Josiah Wong](https://jdw.ong/), [Yunfan Jiang](https://yunfanj.com/), [Chen Wang](https://www.chenwangjeremy.net/), and [Ruohan Zhang](https://ai.stanford.edu/~zharu/) for their invaluable advice on both research and life.
